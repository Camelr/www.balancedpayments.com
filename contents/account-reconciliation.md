  bodyText: Whether you&#8217re a goods/services marketplace or a crodfunding/donation platform, Balanced enables you to link related transactions and maintain a separate order balance to help reconcile your accounting.

intro:
  - step: 1
    title: Debit the buyer
    body: Create an order by debiting the buyer and assigning the funds to the appropriate merchant.
  - step: 2
    title: Hold funds
    body: Funds are held in an order balance, separate from all other orders. Funds must be paid to merchants within 30 days of the change.
  - step: 3
    title: Settle funds to the merchant
    body: Pay the merchant and collect your fee. Only one merchant is allowed per order.

features:

  - title: Prevent losses
    body: Since each order maintains a separate balance, you cannot use unreferenced funds to issue credits. Orders also offer additional safeguards for disputes. Once a dispute is filed, orders prevent you from unknowingly refunding the buyer as the dispute process is pending.

  - title: Combine payouts from multiple orders
    body: Balanced allows you to issue one payout to a merchant with multiple orders waiting to be settled. Each customer has an associated sweep account which can carry a stored balance. Simply credit the funds from the various orders into your merchant's sweep account. Then issue one payout from the sweep account to your merchant's bank account.
